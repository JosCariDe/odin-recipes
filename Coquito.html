    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."

        <li>Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>

        <li>White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li>Water: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch</li>
